        <h3>Communication & PR</h3>
        <p>I have almost 10 years of experience managing the communication of several different organisations
        and companies within two different PR Consultancies and also as a Communication Manager. I designed and
        implemented <strong>360 Comms Plans that developed the different communication channels</strong> of the organisations, including social media,
        and established institutional and media relations.
        The ESIC Master in Communication and Advertising Management also required me to create various <strong>marketing and digital marketing plans</strong> for different projects, so I had the opportunity to learn how to implement these skills and tools in different areas.</p>

        <h3>Content writing</h3>
        <p>I have a degree in <strong>Journalism</strong> from the Complutense University of Madrid with two years of specialisation and writing practice in solidarity journalism,
          which has provided me with strong writing skills.
          I have been creating corporate content for magazines, websites, blogs, press releases, newsletters, opinion articles or presentations for 10 years in areas such as technology, transport, energy or sustainability.
          My <strong>academic background in Law, Sociology and Political Sciences</strong> has provided me with extensive resources for the creation of content related to social sciences.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have always been curious about coding. In my work as a communication consultant I have used <strong>CMS (Wordpress)</strong> and html to manage and update content on websites or newsletters.
          At the beginning of 2020 I decided to study web development in depth and have done a specialisation course in which I have learned to use several programming languages in a more professional way: <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>.</p>

        <img class="skill-img" src="images/languages.png" alt="web">
        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I am fluent in <strong>Spanish and English (C2)</strong>, and I have developed my late work in both languages, including
         managing relationships with investors and clients and creating contents in both languages for Social
         Media and the website, as well as op-eds and press releases. I have also studied other languages such
         as <strong>French (High-C1), Portuguese (High-B2/C1) or Arabic (Basic-A1)</strong>, and I am currently studying <strong>Russian (Intermediate-B1)</strong>. I truly enjoy learning and
         studying languages, and I consider the use of language and grammar an essential tool for PR &
         Communication- I love reading and writing, and I attach great importance to these abilities in my
         working method, as interesting contents are key to reach the media, clients and public opinion.</p>

      <h3>An overview of my interests </h3>
      <div class="hobbies">

    <p>I am very curious and restless, and among the courses & training I have done in parallel with my professional career are the following:
<ul>
  <li>I was founding president and later RDR (District Representative for Spain) at <strong>Rotaract (Rotary International)</strong>, working as a volunteer for more than 6 years developing solidarity projects.</li>
  <li>RYLA Scholarship (Rotary Youth Leadership Awards). I got to participate in a leadership course where I learned a lot about project and team management.</li>
  <li>I am a <strong>PADI Divemaster</strong>, which is the first professional level for scuba divers. Thus, I am authorised to supervise and guide recreational scuba divers. In the Summer of 2018 I was an intern at ZOEA √Åguilas in Murcia during a month, helping with logistics at the diving center and assisting instructors with student divers and turists who wanted to try scuba diving.</li>
  <li>Complementing my education as a diver, I am also trained in Nitrox, Deep Diving or EFR (Emergency First Rescue). I passed the PER exam (Recreational Boat Skipper) but honestly I am not very good at it. </li>
 <li>I studied <strong>music and piano for more than a decade at the Conservatory</strong> in Vigo, where I am from. Nowadays I still play the piano at least once a week as it helps me de-stress.</li>
 <li>Among other courses, I have also studied: Aeronautical & Aerospace Law (2011), Negotiation Techniques (2012) or Criminal Law Expert (2014).</li>
</ul>
