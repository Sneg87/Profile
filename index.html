        <h3>Communication & PR</h3>
        <p>I have almost 10 years of experience managing the communication of several different organisations
        and companies within two different PR Consultancies and also as a Communications Manager. I designed and
        applied <strong>360 Comms Plans that developed the different communication channels</strong> of the organisations, including social media,
        and established media as well as institutional relations.
        The ESIC Master also required me to create <strong>marketing and digital marketing plans</strong> for the different master¬¥s projects, so I had the opportunity to learn how to apply this skills in different sectors.</p>

        <p>I have a degree in <strong>Journalism</strong> from the Complutense University of Madrid with two years of specialization and writing practice in solidarity journalism,
          which has provided me with strong writing skills.
          I have been creating corporate content for magazines, websites, blogs, press releases, newsletters, opinion articles or presentations for 10 years in areas such as technology, transport, energy or sustainability.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I've always been curious about coding. In my work as a communication consultant I have used <strong>CMS (Wordpress)</strong> and html to manage and update content on websites or newsletters.
          In 2020 I decided to study web development in depth and have done a specialization course in which I have learned to use several programming languages in a more professional way: <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I am fluent in both <strong>Spanish and English (C2)</strong>, and I have developed my late work in both languages, including
         managing relationships with investors and clients and creating contents in both languages for Social
         Media and the website, as well as op-eds and press releases. I have also studied other languages such
         as <strong>French (C1), Portuguese (B2-C1) or Arabic (A1)</strong>, and I am currently studying <strong>Russian (B1)</strong>. I truly enjoy learning and
         studying languages, and I consider the use of language and grammar an essential tool for PR &
         Communication- I love reading and writing, and I attach great importance to these abilities in my
         working method, as interesting contents are key to reach the media.</p>
